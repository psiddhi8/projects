# Projects
### 1. Client-Server Chat Program (Python)
#### This program is a chat program with a list of users saved in the chat program. Users can log into the server and chat with each other and also find out who is online. This program is resistant to man in the middle attacks because a key establishment protocol using Needham-Schroeder was implemented between clients as well as using AES-GCM encrpytion.

### 2. Image Processor (Java)
#### This program allows you to upload photos and apply edits. The photos can be blurred and sharpened. Filters can also be applied, such as sepia and greyscale. You can also downscale the size of the image or create a mosaic of the image uploaded. Multiple images can also be uploaded to be layered together and blended. Finally, you can export the image once you have edited the image to your liking.

### 3. Maze (Java)
#### This program is a interactive maze that uses the up, down, left, and right arrow keys. The maze starts in the top-left corner and ends in the bottom right. The maze also has the option of being auto-completed by pressing the 'b' key for a breadth-first approach or the 'd' key for a depth-first approach.

### 4. Calculator (Assembly)
#### This program is a four-function calculator.

### 5. FloodIt (Java)
#### This program is a replication of the FloodIt game. This game is played by starting with the color in the top-left corner and continuing until the whole board is covered in one color. The point of the game is to do this in the least amount of steps possible.
